## User Stories
We’ve come up with a couple of user stories, and have decided to split them up into each “work-flow”. Below you’ll find the user stories for each group, the groups are “as a user logging in”, “as a logged in user”, “as a user that wants to listen to music”, and “as a user that wants to watch a show/movie”.

### As a User logging in
- I would like to be able to log into the service using a third-party application, such as Gmail or Facebook – so that I can log in easily and avoid a whole sign up process if I can.

### As a logged in User
- I would like the system to recognize me as an existing user so that I can have a unique user experience.
- I would like to be able to have a playlist or a TV show/movie chosen for me in one place, so that I can quickly get to listening/watching.
- I would like to see a list of movies that I have already watched, and a list of playlists that I have listened to so that I can refer back to them if I want to recommend to friends or watch again.

### As a logged in User that wants to watch a show/movie
- I would like to be able to select a genre of TV show/movie that I like or feel like watching, and have the system suggest something based on the genre I chose.
- I would like the option of clicking a button and having something randomly chosen for me to watch, so I don’t have to spend countless minutes scrolling through huge lists of options.
- I would like to be able to tell the system to “suggest another one” if I don’t like the generated option – this could be split into “not now” (add media back into pool for future suggestion) and “block” (never shows again).
- I would like the ability to pick and avoid specific genres being suggested at all if I choose a to have something randomly generated for me – i.e. a filter.

### As a logged in User that wants to listen to music
- I would like the system to suggest music to me based on what I’m going to do – i.e. given a task (clean the house) it generates a playlist that matches that activity.
- I would like the system to be able to match the mood outside (of the weather) – and if I choose this option, then I want to be notified and be able to accept or deny the location request to check current location’s weather.
