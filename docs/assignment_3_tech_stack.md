We chose Node.js and (database name here)
Why we chose node:
- It has many built in functions, and we can do both back end and front end with it. In creating a node project, we can hit GET/POST routes to APIs and forms, and render data using a templater (PUG). We decided to choose this framework because it's easy to work with and all in one. Plus, we get access to NPM packages that we can simply install and easily use.
- We bounced between Node and Django, but since some teammates are comfortable with the javascript language and Node framework, most of us are not well-versed in Django nor know much about it, we thought it would be best to stick to something that is more familiar to at least some of us.
